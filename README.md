Harmful algae blooms(HAB), which are overgrowths of cyanobacteria, are a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems. When created, HABs produce dangerous toxins that can cause illness in people and animals. More specifically, these toxins are consumed by small fish/shellfish and move up the food chain, devestating ecosystems by spreading illness. Algae blooms also reduce oxygen content in water, literally suffocating aquatic life. This project utilizes data from Blackhawk, Green Valley, South Twin, and Swan Lake located in Iowa to predict Chlorophyll concentrations based on historic 2014-2018 data. My features include pH, dissolved oxygen content, and temperature.
